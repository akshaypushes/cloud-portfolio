## Course Overview

This course covered how to turn raw data into actionable insights using Google Cloud tools. Key modules included:

- **Value of Data & Data Value Chain**  
  – How data drives business value  
  – Stages: Ingest → Process → Store → Analyze → Act

- **Data Management Concepts**  
  – Structured vs. semi-structured vs. unstructured  
  – Governance and compliance best practices

- **Storage Options**  
  – Choosing between Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Firestore, and Cloud SQL  
  – Use-cases for each (e.g., object storage vs. relational)

- **Database Modernization**  
  – When to migrate vs. refactor  
  – Tools for lift-and-shift and managed migrations

- **Business Intelligence with Looker**  
  – Modeling data views in LookML  
  – Dashboard creation and sharing

- **Streaming Analytics & Data Integration**  
  – Pub/Sub for event ingestion  
  – Dataflow for serverless pipelines

## Hands-On Labs & Notes

1. **Dataset Creation in BigQuery**  
   – Steps to create, load, and query a table  
   – Learned best practices for partitioning and clustering  

2. **Streaming Pipeline**  
   – Set up a Pub/Sub topic → Dataflow pipeline → BigQuery sink  
   – Simulated IoT data; monitored lag and throughput

3. **Looker Explores**  
   – Built a simple sales dashboard  
   – Used LookML to define derived tables and user permissions

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding the **data value chain** is critical before choosing tools.  
- **Governance** and access control (IAM roles) must be baked in from Day 1.  
- **Serverless pipelines** (Pub/Sub + Dataflow) drastically reduce ops overhead.  
- BI tools like **Looker** empower non-technical stakeholders.

> **Next Steps:**  
> - Start hands-on labs for IAM & Compute (Week 1)  
> - Build out Terraform modules for dataset provisioning  
> - Draft cost-optimization case study around partitioned tables
