## Course Overview

This course dove into applying AI/ML on Google Cloud, covering:

- **AI & ML Fundamentals**  
  – Definitions, differences vs. BI/analytics  
  – Problem types suited for ML, quality data  

- **Responsible AI**  
  – Explainability, fairness, privacy  

- **Google Cloud AI/ML Solutions**  
  – BigQuery ML for in-database modeling  
  – Pre-trained APIs (Vision, NL, Speech, Video)  
  – AutoML GUI workflows  
  – Custom training with TensorFlow  
  – Working with TPUs for acceleration  

---

## Hands-On Labs & Notes

1. **BigQuery ML Demo**  
   – Built and evaluated a classification model via SQL  
2. **Calling a Pre-trained API**  
   – Vision API call to label images programmatically  
3. **AutoML Training**  
   – Uploaded CSV, triggered GUI model build, deployed endpoint  
4. **Custom TensorFlow Training**  
   – Container-based training job on Vertex AI  
5. **TPU Experiment**  
   – Benchmarked TensorFlow step times on CPU vs. TPU

## Key Takeaways

- Picking the right AI/ML solution depends on **skill level**, **use-case**, and **scale**.  
- **Responsible AI** must be baked into every step.  
- **Serverless** options (AutoML, BigQuery ML) remove infra friction.  
- **Custom training + TPUs** unlocks maximum performance & flexibility.
